    <div class="card-body bg-white">
        <p>TENs are collaborations of taxonomic experts who work together to agree upon a consensus classification for their plant groups. TENs are the preferred approach for empowering the taxonomic community to contribute to a global checklist of plants as community-based consensus classifications are more robust and more sustainable than those produced by individuals.</p>
        <p>TENs are encouraged to work at the family level, but we recognize that in some cases a different taxonomic rank may be more appropriate. Above the rank of family, we have ‘major group’ TENs (e.g. bryophytes, pteridophytes and conifers) and order-level TENs (e.g. Caryophyllales, Commelinales and Dipsacales). We also have a few suprageneric TENs (e.g. Boraginaceae subtribe Amsinckiinae and Papaveraceae tribe Papaverae), although these are seen as ‘stepping stones’ that will later become part of a family-level TEN.</p>
        <p>A TEN is responsible for curating all names in their taxonomic group, however, we acknowledge that for most TENs this will be work in progress, with TENs providing incremental updates focussed on the taxa being actively worked on, whist other taxa await taxonomic scrutiny.</p>
        <p>We ask TENs to be open, inclusive, representative and collaborative. They should include specialists from across the geographic distribution of the plant group, cover a range of taxonomic viewpoints, and be open to new membership.</p>
